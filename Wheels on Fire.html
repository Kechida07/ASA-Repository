		<p style="color: white; font-style:oblique; font-size: 23px; text-align: center; padding: 150px; position:relative; top: -250px;">At Wheels on Fire, we like to think buying a car can be almost as fun as actually driving one. With several years of experience in the automotive industry, I have somehow managed built a reputation for delivering exceptional service, expert advice, and top-quality vehicles to meet every customer's needs.</p>
		<p style="color: white; font-style:oblique; font-size: 23px; text-align: center; padding: 150px; position:relative; top: -450px;">Our philosophy? Honest deals, straightforward pricing, and no unnecessary small talk — because we know you didn’t come here for a TED Talk on tire pressure. So, if you're in the market for a car and like your transactions with a side of efficiency, stop by and give us a chance to underwhelm you in the best possible way.</p>
